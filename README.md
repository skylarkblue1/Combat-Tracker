# Combat Tracker Console App for Call of Cthulhu 7e

A small console text-based application written in c++ for use in running Call of Cthulhu games.

I've created this as I've recently started running games in the system and keeping track of combat encounters is something I've been struggling with. Since making huge giant databases full of every enemy, spell, etc would be a bit too much I'm only updating this with the data I need for the scenarios I'm running.

### Current scenarios this is supporting:
- [Dead Boarder](https://www.chaosium.com/content/FreePDFs/CoC/Cult%20of%20Chaos%20Scenarios/Dead%20Boarder.pdf)

### Current features:
- Input Characters (Name, HP, DEX) to a JSON file database

### Planned features:
- Colour variable for characters (We use coloured tokens for player markers)
- Health tracking for characters and enemies
- Spells/Abilities prompting and tracking
- Status effects tracking
- Turn order sorting and tracking

More features can be added if something more is needed.
